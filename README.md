## 📖 Overview
GeniusBot is a **Full-Stack AI Application** that dynamically adapts its personality and logic based on the user's needs. Unlike generic chatbots, it uses a **State-Aware Local Expert System** to provide structured, professional analysis for specific domains.

### 🌟 Features
*   **Dynamic Personas**:
    *   ⚖️ **Legal Expert**: Cites precedents, uses formal jargon, and generates legal case reports.
    *   🩺 **Medical Consultant**: Performs symptom triage, asks for severity/duration, and provides health advice.
    *   🎓 **Education Tutor**: Creates custom lesson plans with metaphors and study tips.
*   **Conversational Memory**: The bot mimics human conversation by asking follow-up questions (e.g., "How long have you had this pain?") before giving a final answer.
*   **Local Expert System**: A custom-built rule engine that generates high-quality, complex Markdown reports without needing external API keys.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
*   **Frontend**: Streamlit (Python)
*   **Logic**: Python 3.12 (State Machine & Pattern Matching)
